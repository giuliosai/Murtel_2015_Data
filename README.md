# Murt√®l Data

## Borehole deformation data (SAA)

The inclinometer (SAA) data consists of MATLAB files which are the output from the Mesurand software which converts raw data (angles) to useful position data. The data is split into 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-23 periods. 

**Instructions:** download the _.mat_ files from the SAA_data folder. Note that the one for the 2018-2023 period is missing as it is too large to upload to GitHub.
